Linear Regression - Predicting House Prices
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict house prices based on various features, such as the number of rooms, crime rate, and more. It is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in learning the fundamental concepts of machine learning, regression techniques, and model evaluation.

The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing Dataset, which is widely used for practicing regression techniques. The goal is to predict the house prices based on different features and evaluate the model's performance.

Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that predicts house prices in the Boston area based on various input features such as:

Crime rate

Average number of rooms per dwelling

Property age

Proximity to employment centers, etc.

Technologies Used
Python for programming

Scikit-learn for building the linear regression model

Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Jupyter Notebooks (optional) for interactive code execution and results visualization

Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Linear-Regression-Predicting-House-Prices.git
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Where requirements.txt contains the necessary libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

3. Running the Project
Open the linear_regression_house_price_prediction.py file (or a Jupyter notebook, if you prefer).

Run the script to see the model training, evaluation, and results.

Data Preprocessing
The project involves the following steps for data preprocessing:

Handling missing data (if applicable)

Data scaling: Standardizing feature values to ensure that they are on a similar scale (especially helpful for regression models).

Splitting the dataset into training and test sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).

Model Building
A Linear Regression model is built using the Scikit-learn library. After training, the model makes predictions based on the test set, and we evaluate the model using various metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R²)

Evaluation Metrics
The model’s performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors (larger errors are penalized more heavily).

R-squared (R²): Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

Visualizations
Several visualizations are generated to assess the model's performance:

Actual vs. Predicted Prices Plot: A scatter plot comparing the true house prices against the predicted ones.

Residuals Plot: A plot to visualize how far the predicted values are from the actual values.

Results
The Linear Regression model provides a baseline for predicting house prices based on various features. The R-squared score and other evaluation metrics are used to gauge how well the model performs. You can experiment with additional features, transformations, or different algorithms to improve the predictions.

For example, the model may achieve an R² score of 0.75, indicating that 75% of the variance in house prices is explained by the features in the dataset.

Future Improvements
Feature Engineering: Adding more features or transforming existing ones could improve model performance.

Regularization: Implementing techniques like Lasso or Ridge Regression to avoid overfitting.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model to find the best hyperparameters and improve accuracy.

Advanced Algorithms: Experiment with more advanced machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to see if they provide better results.

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"MAE: {mae}")
print(f"MSE: {mse}")
